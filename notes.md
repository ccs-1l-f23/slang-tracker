### Corpora
#### [NLTK Data](https://www.nltk.org/nltk_data/)
- (65) Word Lists (id: words) is the UNIX words list
- (74) Stopwords Corpus (id: stopwords) are a good list of stopwords
- (93) The Reuters-21578 benchmark corpus (id: reuters) which is good for newspaper
- (102) Brown Corpus (id: brown)

#### [SCOWL](http://wordlist.aspell.net/)
- en_US defaults

#### [Word frequency data](https://www.wordfrequency.info/)
- Could be useful for filtering out common words
- But I think you have to pay for anything more than samples

#### [English-Corpora.org](https://www.english-corpora.org/)
- This is the holy grail but requires payment :(

#### [Google Books N-grams](https://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html)
- Haven't looked into using this but could be great

#### In total
- reuters + brown + words + scowl seems to catch most words that I want to remove
